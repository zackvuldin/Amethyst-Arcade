## Project Description

Amethyst Arcade is an application that will have access to many classic games, but with a twist! I will be focusing on creating Snake as my MVP and learning how div collision works. I will have MANY Post MVP such as having the food the snake eats have different affixes like increasing snake speed or increasing length by 2. Other Post MVPS will be to create other games like other classics such as pong or hanoi tower. I also want to be creative and make a pre-alpha version of a platformer or OSU!
